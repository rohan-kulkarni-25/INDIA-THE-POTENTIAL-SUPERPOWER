                    A potential superpower is a state or a political and economic entity that is speculated to be , or
                    to be in the process of becoming, a superpower at some point in the 21st century. Presently, it is
                    widely considered that only the United States currently fulfills the criteria to be considered a
                    superpower. States most commonly mentioned as being potential superpowers are Brazil, China, the
                    European Union (a supranational entity),<SPAN class="highlight">India</SPAN> and Russia, based on a
                    variety of factors.<br>
                    Several media publications and academics have discussed the Republic of becoming a superpower.<b>Is
                        India really shining?Is it really on the path of becoming a superpower?</b> Optimistic Indians
                    would assert an affirmation but it is time one had a reality check India is surely marching ahead,
                    but are all the Indians marching ahead or is it just a small fraction of the population doing so?
                    India can surely boast of a growth rate of around 8-9 per cent, but one needs to ask if this growth
                    is trickling down to the lower strata of the populace.<br>
                    Sixty three years ago in 1947 when India got independence , the question then asked was ‘ will India
                    survive’? today, India’s economic profile has changed. At over a trillion dollars, it is a force to
                    reckon with not just in Asia but in the entire world. With its new currency symbol to be
                    internationalized soon, India now flexes its financial muscle.<br>
                    Soon after independence our nation was in turmoil. Assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, tragic partition
                    rendering millions of people homeless tribal invasion in J&K coupled with problem of consolidation
                    of five hundred princely states, to build a new nation was a mammoth task. <i><b><span
                                class="highlight">After going through different phases of lows and highs, the doubtful
                                query ‘will India survive’ has been replaced by more hopeful query, will India become a
                                superpower?</span></i></b><br>

                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="hist">
                <h2><mark>HISTORY</mark></h2>
                <P>India's earliest settlements are believed to have developed in the culture hearths of the Indus
                    Valley around 2600 BCE and in the Ganges Valley around 1500 BCE.
                    <br>Aryan tribes are believed to have then invaded the area after they migrated into the Indian
                    subcontinent from the northwest. It is thought that they introduced the caste system, which is still
                    common in many parts of India today. During the fourth century BCE, Alexander the Great introduced
                    Greek practices into the region when he expanded across Central Asia. During the third century BCE,
                    the Mauryan Empire came into power in India and was most successful under its emperor,
                    Ashoka.Throughout subsequent periods Arab, Turkish and Mongol peoples entered India and in 1526, a
                    Mongol Empire was established there, which later expanded throughout most of northern India. During
                    this time, such landmarks as the Taj Mahal were also constructed.<br>
                    Much of India's history after the 1500s was dominated by British influences. The first British
                    colony was established in 1619 by the English East India Company at Surat. Shortly thereafter,
                    permanent trading stations opened in present-day Chennai, Mumbai, and Kolkata. British influence
                    then continued to expand from these initial trading stations and by the 1850s, most of India and
                    other countries such as Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh were controlled by Britain. Queen
                    Victoria of England took the title of Empress of India in 1876.<br>
                    By the late 1800s, India began a long struggle working toward independence from Britain. That
                    finally happened in the 1940s, when Indian citizens began to unite and British Labor Prime Minister
                    Clement Attlee (1883–1967) began to push for India's independence. On August 15, 1947, India
                    officially became a dominion within the Commonwealth and Jawaharlal Nehru (1889–1964) was named
                    India's Prime Minister. India's first constitution was written shortly thereafter on January 26,
                    1950, and at that time, it officially became a member of the British Commonwealth.<br>
                    Since gaining its independence, India has undergone significant growth in terms of its population
                    and economy, however, there have been periods of instability in the country and much of its
                    population today lives extreme poverty.

                <h2><mark>GEOGRAPHY</mark> </h2>
                <p>The geography of India is diverse and can be divided into three main regions. The first is the
                    rugged, mountainous Himalayan region in the northern part of the country, while the second is called
                    the Indo-Gangetic Plain. It is in this region that most of India's large-scale agriculture takes
                    place. The third geographic region in India is the plateau region in the southern and central
                    portions of the country. India also has three major river systems, all of which have large deltas
                    that take over a large portion of the land. These are the Indus, Ganges, and Brahmaputra Rivers.<br>
                    India's climate is also varied but is tropical in the south and mainly temperate in the north. The
                    country also has a pronounced monsoon season from June to September in its southern portion.<br>
                    Hindi and English are India's official languages, but there are also 17 regional languages that are
                    considered official.<br>
                    India has several cities that have undergone place name changes such as Bombay being renamed Mumbai.
                    These changes were mainly done in an effort to return the city names to local dialects, as opposed
                    to British translations.</p>

        <div id="indsp">
            <P>India has yet to cross over many plateaus before it becomes a superpower in league with big nations.<br>
                I shall discuss here some of the core issues that if not attended to with strong political will and time
                bound action may rock the boat of country’s economic rejuvenation.</P>
            <p><b>Escalating Population</b><BR>
                India is second most populous country in the world, with over 1,210,193,422 people more than a sixth of
                world’s population. Already containing 17.31 per cent of the world population, India is projected to be
                populous country by 2025 surpassing China. India occupies 2.4 per cent of the world’s land and supports
                17.5 per cent of world’s population. It seems the Govt has stopped all efforts to control the population
                explosion. Fearing public unrest and possible loss of vote bank after Sanjay Gandhi the successive
                Governments abandoned family planning programmes if at all some programme is being executed it is only
                as tokenism without political will.</p>
            <p><b>EDUCATION SYSTEM AND CASTISM</b><BR>
                China which is India’s competitor in becoming superpower is empowering its youth by opening up high
                number of universities, imparting education and teaching English. India, on the other hand, is still
                fighting implementation of quotas for students and faculty. Meanwhile, students with potential have to
                resort to continuing education in private universities which often fail to meet the required standards.
            </p>
            <p><b>MONSOON AND AGRICULTURE</b><BR>
                Agriculture and allied sectors like forestry and village industry account 16 per cent of GDP and despite
                a steady decline of its share in GDP, is still the largest economic sector which plays a significant
                role in the overall socio-economic development of the country. Slow agriculture growth is a major area
                of concern is tow- third of country’s population depends on rural employment for living. Monsoon plays a
                crucial role in agriculture production. Due to lack of adequate irrigation system, increased dependence
                on monsoon has tremendous impact on Indian agriculture; failure of monsoon, as we have seen in the past,
                has the capacity to destabilize the entire economy of the country.</p>
            <p><i><b>Any country on a growth trajectory has to face several hurdles created by external and internal
                        factors during transition period. It largely depends on the collective will power of the
                        citizens who face these changing’s and overcome all obstacles that may come in the way of their
                        country becoming a superpower. However, going by the slogan,<mark
                            style="background-color: rgb(255, 240, 105);"> ‘man mai hai vishawas pura hai vishwas hum
                            hongay kamyab aik din’</mark>, we shall overcome someday.</b></i></p>
